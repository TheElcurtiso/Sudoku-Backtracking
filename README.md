# Sudoku-Backtracking

This is just my attempt at trying to put recursive backtracking into sudoku so I don't have to figure out all the logic. It took me longer than I thought but now that its done I might add some sort of GUI to make it look nicer.

Essentially what this program does is fill out answers until it no longer works in which it then goes back to the previously correct state and tries a different answer to create a different path to (hopefully) let us reach the correct answer eventually. The solution is basically brute-forcing the correct path.
